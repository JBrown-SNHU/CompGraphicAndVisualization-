Reflection:

Working with OpenGL has taught me to design software with much patience and consideration; just like with regular software designing, there are multiple ways to arrive at your end goal. You have to take the time and energy to figure out the possible solution and see if that solution fits best for the project as a whole. For this project in particular, I would change or create one aspect of the project, whether it was adding a new object or incorporating a new texture or light, and then see how the code affected the project. By doing too much too quickly, I often find that I have problems and don't know where the error originated. I plan to use the approach of patience and frequent error checking in all future development to ensure I'm always productive in my work and not creating miscellaneous bugs in my code.

As I worked on the code throughout the milestones, I found towards the beginning that I had a hard time working with OpenGL. There were many concepts that I couldn't understand at first, and I would often get overwhelmed, especially during week 3 (the first coding milestone); however, after taking a break for a while, I would often come back with a new perspective on the problems that I was having, and those new perspectives would often lead to a new understanding and a new solution.

As I begin to move forward in my computer science education and career, there are a great deal of personal projects that I wish to work on. My work in this course has helped me realize there are ways to incorporate graphics and visualization into these projects, allowing my personal projects and ideas to grow to further heights. I also have the opportunity to use some of what I learned in my career when I get a job as an engineer in the future. Whether in personal work or my career, I will utilize the practices and concepts I learned in this class and my other classes to push past my limits and continue to grow as a software developer.
